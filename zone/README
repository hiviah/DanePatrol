Here are some generated CA certs, server certs and zone with TLSA records for
testing purposes. Certificates are to be used in a server like Apache or nginx
(don't forget to include the CA cert in the chain).

All passwords for the test keys are: 1234

To generate an additional certificate, use:

1. openssl-1.0.1c/misc/CA.pl -newreq
2. rename generated newkey.pem and newreq.pem to something like server3.csr and server3.key
3. openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -out server3.crt -infiles server3.csr

For generating the TLSA records, use https://github.com/pieterlexis/swede, e.g.:

./swede --insecure create --usage 0 --selector 1 --mtype 2 localhost

Add the generated TLSA records to tlsa-test file (that's the zone file for a
mock domain 'tlsa-test'). Resign zone with (you need 'bind' installed):

dnssec-signzone tlsa-test

The generated signed zone 'tlsa-test.signed' is then added to locally running
unbound/bind so that you can test the zone. See options 'local-zone' and
'local-data' in unbound.conf.
